            <p><h5>Smart devices are interactive electronic gadgets that understand simple commands sent by users and help in daily activities.
                Some of the most commonly used smart devices are smartphones, tablets, phablets, smartwatches, smart glasses and other personal electronics.
                While many smart devices are small, portable personal electronics, they are in fact defined by their ability to connect to a network to share and interact remotely. 
                Many TV sets and refrigerators are also therefore considered smart devices.Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS)
                 integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre-installed and third-party software
